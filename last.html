                                I am still keeping our tradition alive. This is the last page hehehe. I hope you enjoyed
                                clicking the hearts away :P. I had this planned for a while. Now I am just looking at my laptop screen trying to form words.
                                The very first thing is Happy born day ,chinguya. I am ever grateful for your existence and also to have you in my life.
                                I can't believe its been more than a year since we last met. And it has been almost six years since we have known each other.
                                </p></div>

                                Now for the mandatory part. i feel like I have already told you everything I want you to know
                                in the previous letters but I am going to write again anyways. I am very proud of you, chinguya.
                                I always am. I hope you remember that. I am so glad that we got to know each other. I dont think I have 
                                told you how much I appreciated your company and your caring self. I love that you are very sincere with 
                                people you care about, that you make me laugh with your unpredictable humor. Like I always say, this is yet again 
                                one more year added to many of our years together. So, cheers to that ðŸ¥‚

                                Now, on a funny note, I am glad that you and I were very punctual people because God knows how late the three
                                roomies were ðŸ¤£. I think that was also one of the ways we actually bonded. Also, you did know the way to my heart.
                                You fed me with food. I don't think I have told you how happy your food and fruits made me. And also Tedhe Medhe.
                                I am sending you loads of hugs and misses, chinguya. I hope we get to meet again soon. <br>
                                I am wishing you a very warm and happy day. I hope you have lots of fun and everything joyful. Heres to another
                                year of us celebrating this day together. Love you, chinguya. Until next time, Borahae ðŸ’œ
